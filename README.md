# novus-physica

C# implementation of the Cyclone physics engine created by Ian Millington. Rendering using OpenTK Open GL bindings available on NuGet. 

# Project Goals
  
  -- Rebuild the physics engine I developed in grad school using Ian's book
  
  -- Build code examples to demonstrate Open GL, Open TK, and physics engines
